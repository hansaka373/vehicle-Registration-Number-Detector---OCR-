# Automated Vehicle Registration Number Recognition and Information Retrievalvehicle info retrieval: OCR detects reg. number from uploaded image/PDF, fetches details from MySQL db. Python, HTML.

This project utilizes Python, HTML, and MySQL to create a system that automates the retrieval of vehicle details using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. When a user uploads an image of a vehicle registration document (in either photo or PDF format), the system employs OCR to extract the registration number. Subsequently, it queries a MySQL database to fetch all relevant details associated with that registration number, such as vehicle make, model, year, and owner information. This project streamlines the process of accessing vehicle information, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Key Features:

OCR integration for registration number extraction.
MySQL database for storing and retrieving vehicle details.
